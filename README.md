# Self-Attention and other Neural Network Models
## Introduction
This repository is aimed at using different neural network models for Natural Language Processing tasks. In this case, the task is to detect whether a given tweet actually 
refers to a disaster or not. <br />
The main aspect of this repository is the coding of the self-attention mechanism, outlined in the paper 
"[Attention is all you need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)" from researchers at Google.
